=== Automate
Automate domain contains enhancements for IT Process automation, lifecycle provisioning,
integrations with providers that Red Hat CloudForms currently supports i.e.
EC2, vCenter, RHEV, Satellite, OpenStack, etc...

IMPORTANT: 3rd party integrations will be included in a separate repo in the near future.

Follow these steps to install the CloudForms_Essentials automate domain:

. Compress/zip the Automate / CloudForms_Essentials directory
. Log into your CloudForms/ManageIQ UI as an administrator
. Navigate to Automate / ImportExport
. Upload the zip file. This can take 60-90 seconds.
. When done, navigate to Automate / Explorer
. You will need to edit the new CloudForms_Essentials domain and check the "enable" box.
. The CloudForms_Essentials automate domain is ready to use!.

TIP: The CloudForms_Essentials automate model is locked by default. To modify something simply create
     a new domain and copy the method, class, etc... to the new domain. This preserves the domain and makes
     it easy to see what changes were made. Great for PRs!
